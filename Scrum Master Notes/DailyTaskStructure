Daily Task Structure

Due by: As soon as possible but Mandatory by 8:45. 
				^^ Takes priority over what you're doing! :)

#-------------------------------Why change our structure-----------------------#
Below is the structured required to submit daily tasks. This structure will
allow and enforce a nice and neat presentation of individuals issues.
Also, this can easily be parsed using python/spark. Do your best to to stick 
to it so we can later process it maybe we can find a trend of what people worked
on or had difficulties with. I will ask you to fix it if I notice discrepancies.
