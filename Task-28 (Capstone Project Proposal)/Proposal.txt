Buisness Goal: 

As an up and coming industry cannabis is just starting and there's a lot of money to be made 
from the medical benefits of cannbis. There are also other key factors like hemp that can be an eco-friendly alternative
to traditional plastic and other harmful to the earth products. Because the medicinal and practical application of canabis it's 
my belief that information about the cost of canabis across a wide variety of vendors can be key to the success of a start-up company.
It is why I want to build a pipeline that can provide valid and clean data of current prices and possible trends.
