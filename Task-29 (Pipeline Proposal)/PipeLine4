Buisness Goal:
Crypto currency has had a downfall for investor but while lucratic and not commercially adopted
there are many companies and individuals who still invest and secure their crypto investments.
This API allows me to get Twitter and event information that can help determine up and coming 
coins a.k.a popular coins. This data can be useful to companies like JP Morgan and others involved
in the crypto currency network. The api also has exchange rates and 1 day of historical data. 
This pipeline will leverage the twitter information per coin and compare that to their price. 


Daily Taks:
Days 1,2,3: Gather twitter and 1 day historical data.Stream using kafka to make mutliple topics related to crypto.
 
Days 4,5,6: Clean the Data and process data to see if theres a connection between price and retweet count.
Days 7,8: Store the data in hive: Crypto Currency, Price, Retweet, Compare to BitCoin.
