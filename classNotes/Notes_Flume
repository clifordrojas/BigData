Flume (More fun with data streaming)
OAuth2 - python request and pull data from server

Starting Flume:
	Make sure hadoop is running to start flume

One of the ways flume is used is for log aggregation
Ingestion Method:
	Data flow/archetecture is very important so request if necessary
	Web Server -> source -> channel -> sink -> HBase
	Agent - Core component 		*	*	     *
	* means things you need to configure
	Source - where does it come from.
		Source types:
			Spooling dir
			Avro, Kafka, Exec, Thrift 
			Netcat..etc
	channel - How data is transferred (buffer in mem or file)
	sink - Where it's going. Can be organized to group. Can only connect
		to one channel.
