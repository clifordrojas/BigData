CAP Theorem also known as Brewer's Theorem states that it is impossible for a distributed data
store to simultaneously provide more than two out of the three gurantees.

Pillars of CAP Theorem are:
Consistency: Every read receives the most recent write 
Availability : Every request received a non error request and the most recent write.
Partition tolerence: System continues to operate despite failures.


Basically it means that because distributed data is "distributed" the data will have latency 
between nodes as those nodes must read/write amongst eachother to replicate the data and ensure
the data are the same.

"A" is paritioned in Nodes: 1,2,3:
currently nodes 1,2,3 have stored "B"

If a is being written in node 1,2 and call is made and read from node 3
the returning result will be "B" and not the most up to date "A"
